        <p>Lil Yachty’s come up continues with the new track “No Hook,” a minimalist track featuring Migos emcee Quavo. As the title states, the song has no chorus and it’s futuristic sounding beat perfectly caters to Lil Yachty’s category-resistant nasal flow.

        <p>There isn’t a single thing Lil Yachty’s doing that someone else isn't doing better, and in richer details. On Lil Boat, his debut mixtape, he makes a grating mess of these varying influences

        <p> Just days after a surprise modeling appearance in Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 3 show, the 18-year-old rapper Lil Yachty is back home in Atlanta, getting his hair outfitted with red beads, as is his trademark. The barbers in the salon call him by his first name, Miles, and know him well enough to chide his recent success. “I’m bootlegging your tracks,” jokes a barber. “Got that Yachty mixtape for $5!” Yachty laughs, enjoying a rare moment to relax between a series of studio sessions. “Oh, Miles,” the barber continues. “I don’t know how it happened, don’t care. But I’m proud of you, boy. You scared me for a minute, but I’m proud of you.”

        <p> "Hundreds of models filled the arena floor, packed together like sardines, dressed mostly in the muted, washed-out colors we’ve come to know over the initial YEEZY seasons, though several more colorful pieces appeared in yellows, oranges and reds matching model and rapper LIL YACHTY'S braids."

        <p> Recently, Yachty dropped a new song titled "All Time," which covers the Rugrats theme song. This formula probably won't work out for everybody but to no surprise, Lil' Boat kills it

        <p> In “Minnesota,” Yatchy’s deceptively simple new song since last year’s equally fresh “Lil Boat,” his cheerful hook (“You need to stay out of the streets if you can’t take the heat/ Cause it get cold like Minnesota”) props up in between free-form verses. The song is part ode to the thirty-second U.S. state, part nonchalant flex on the haters. There are piano notes that hang like some chillingly sharp breeze, low-frequency bass rumbles practically ready to avalanche, and ice-cold lines from the rapper that convey the trademark toughness of contemporary Atlanta street rap.
